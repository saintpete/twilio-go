Thanks to Andrew Watson for reporting.

## 0.57

Switch all imports to use the `"context"` library.

## 0.56

Use the new github.com/kevinburke/rest.DefaultTransport RoundTripper for
easy HTTP debugging. (The previous code set the RoundTripper to nil, so
kevinburke/rest wouldn't log anything).

Initial support for the Pricing API (https://pricing.twilio.com).

exists) from an alert.

## 0.45

Fix go 1.6 (messages_example_test) relied on the stdlib Context package by
accident.

Support filtering Calls/Messages down to the nanosecond in a TZ-aware way, with
Calls.GetCallsInRange / Messages/GetMessagesInRange.

## 0.42

Use the same JWT library instead of using two different ones.

Add Description() for Alert bodies.

## 0.40

Fix next page URL's for Twilio Monitor
